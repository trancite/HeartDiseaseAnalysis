# HeartDiseaseAnalysis
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset using Python and scikit-learn. It employs statistical techniques and various machine learning models, including ensemble methods, to predict health outcomes. The aim is to provide insights and improve the understanding of factors influencing heart disease.

It is divided into two sections.

The first section is an exhaustive analysis of the dataset that, using statistical and visualization tools, aims to provide a clear view of how the data is distributed and how it can offer useful information.

The second section consists of creating a machine learning model that, based on the previous analysis, attempts to adapt and perform well in predicting the HeartDisease feature of the dataset.
